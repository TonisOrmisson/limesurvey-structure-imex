### Phase 2: Comprehensive Testing Strategy ‚úÖ MAJOR PROGRESS!
20. ‚úÖ **Update ComprehensiveAttributeExportTest.php** 
    - ‚úÖ Added data provider entries for ALL 29 question types (130 test cases total!)
    - ‚úÖ Test 2-4 representative attributes per question type  
    - ‚úÖ Ensured both global and language-specific attributes are tested

21. ‚úÖ **Fix question creation issues in comprehensive test**
    - ‚úÖ Fixed qid => NULL issue (LimeSurvey question code validation)
    - ‚úÖ Fixed alphanumeric-only requirement for question codes
    - ‚úÖ All question types can now be created properly in test environment

22. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Comprehensive test execution status**
    - ‚úÖ 130 test cases created covering all question types
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Some test cases failing (need attribute definition updates)
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Need to debug and fix failing assertions for complete success

### Phase 3: Validation and Integration  
23. ‚ùå **Update QuestionAttributeDefinition for all types**
    - Ensure all 29 question types have proper attribute definitions
    - Verify isValidAttribute() works for all types
    - Verify isNonDefaultValue() works for all types

24. ‚ùå **Integration testing**
    - Test complete export cycle for all question types
    - Verify multi-language attributes work for all types
    - Test that no question type breaks the export

### Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup
25. ‚ùå **Update test documentation**
    - Document which attributes are tested for each question type
    - Create coverage report showing 100% question type coverage
    - Document any question types with special requirements

### Question Attribute System Redesign

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
1. ‚úÖ **Create QuestionAttributeDefinition class** 
   - Define interface for question type -> attributes mapping
   - Each attribute must have: name, default_value, validation_rules
   - Support all LimeSurvey question types (T, L, Z, O, M, F, Q, K, N, X, P, S, *, etc.)
   - Must be easily extensible for new question types
   - Location: `src/validation/QuestionAttributeDefinition.php`

2. ‚úÖ **Define attributes for basic question types first**
   - Start with: T (Long free text), L (Dropdown), N (Numerical)
   - Research LimeSurvey core to find accurate default values
   - Each attribute definition must include exact default value from LimeSurvey core

3. ‚úÖ **Create comprehensive test for QuestionAttributeDefinition**
   - Test that all question types return proper attribute definitions
   - Test that default values are correctly defined
   - Test extensibility (adding new question types)

#### Phase 2: Export Integration  
4. ‚úÖ **Update ExportQuestions to use QuestionAttributeDefinition**
   - Replace current filtering logic with QuestionAttributeDefinition
   - Only export attributes defined for each question type
   - Only export attributes where value != default_value
   - Remove all hardcoded attribute lists

5. ‚ùå **Create export tests for each question type**
   - Test that only defined attributes are exported
   - Test that default values are NOT exported  
   - Test that non-default values ARE exported
   - Create test for each major question type (T, L, M, N minimum)

#### Phase 3: Import Integration
6. ‚ùå **Update ImportStructure to use QuestionAttributeDefinition**
   - Replace current validation with QuestionAttributeDefinition
   - Reject any attributes not defined for question type
   - Validate attribute values according to definition rules

7. ‚ùå **Create import tests for each question type**
   - Test that undefined attributes are rejected
   - Test that defined attributes are imported correctly
   - Test that default values work correctly
   - Test database changes are applied correctly

#### Phase 4: Complete All Question Types
8. ‚ùå **Complete all remaining LimeSurvey question types**
   - Add definitions for: Z, O, F, Q, K, X, P, S, *, etc.
   - Research and verify default values for each
   - Add tests for each question type

9. ‚ùå **Integration testing**
   - Test complete export -> import cycle for each question type
   - Test that attributes roundtrip correctly
   - Test error handling for invalid attributes

10. ‚ùå **Documentation and cleanup**
    - Document new QuestionAttributeDefinition system
    - Remove old validation code
    - Update README with new approach

### make functional tests work on github actions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ make sure the database defined in .env exists and is created (created limesurvey_vendor_test)
- ‚úÖ make sure you can install the lime application from scratch in a new database defined in tests .env
  - Successfully installed LimeSurvey in vendor folder
  - Database: limesurvey_vendor_test (as defined in tests/.env)
- ‚úÖ CHECK!! that the new installation contains the Lime tables (its actually installed)
  - SUCCESS: 59 LimeSurvey tables created including lime_plugins table
- ‚úÖ The app is not required to run in web browser but it must be functional for us in tests & database access mode
- ‚úÖ work out a way that the plugin can be installed for the app running in the vendor folder (added to GitHub Actions)
- ‚úÖ make sure that the plugin is installed in the app running in the vendor folder. Check the database plugins table!!
  - Plugin files copied to vendor/limesurvey/limesurvey/upload/plugins/StructureImEx
  - Plugin dependencies installed (openspout/openspout)
  - Plugin successfully registered in database: ID: 18, Active: YES
  - Created simple-plugin-installer.php service to handle plugin registration
  - Verified: StructureImEx appears in lime_plugins table as active user plugin
- 
- ‚úÖ try to run unit tests in the app running in the vendor folder
  - SUCCESS: All unit tests pass (1 test, 3 assertions)
  - Using vendor LimeSurvey installation with environment variables
- ‚úÖ try to run functional tests in the app running in the vendor folder
  - SUCCESS: 20 out of 21 tests pass (150 assertions)
  - 1 failure: testQuestionLocalizationSystem (looking for 'lime_questions' table)
  - 1 risky: Debug output from DebugSurveyStructureTest (expected)
  - Overall: Functional tests work in vendor environment!
- ‚úÖ make sure the functional & unit tests configuration suits the github actions infra. the .env.example file should be with the suitable conf to work on github actions
  - Added plugin registration step to GitHub Actions workflow
  - Updated .env.example to use limesurvey_vendor_test database
  - Ensured all environment variables match between local and CI
- ‚úÖ review the github workflows. please keep only ONE workflow
  - Removed php.yml, static-analysis.yml, and tests.yml
  - Kept only test.yml which includes all jobs: unit-tests, functional-tests, and code-quality
